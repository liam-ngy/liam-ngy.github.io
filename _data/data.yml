      - title: AeroRecipe iOS App
        link: "#hook"
        tagline: |
          For my own personal growth and learning, I am currently developing an private iOS app AeroRecipe, focused on providing a vast collection of coffee recipes. 
          The app is designed for offline usage, allowing users to access an extensive range of AeroPress coffee recipes without an internet connection.
          One of the challenges I encountered was the absence of a public API for the website [AeroRecipe](https://aeroprecipe.com). 
          To overcome this challenge, I developed a custom script utilizing Elixir and leveraging the capabilities of Floki, an HTML parsing library.           

          Additionally, I used [Explorer](https://github.com/elixir-nx/explorer) based on Polars, which is the equivalent of Pandas but written in Rust.
          During the development process, I utilized [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/), a tool similar to Jupyter,
          to explore and analyze the data in an interactive environment.
          The app is being built with SwiftUI and utilizes Core Data for seamless data management.
