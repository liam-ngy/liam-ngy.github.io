#       - title: AeroRecipe iOS App
#         link: "#hook"
#         tagline: |
#           For my own personal growth and learning, I am currently developing an private iOS app AeroRecipe, focused on providing a vast collection of coffee recipes. 
#           The app is designed for offline usage, allowing users to access an extensive range of AeroPress coffee recipes without an internet connection.
#           One of the challenges I encountered was the absence of a public API for the website [AeroRecipe](https://aeroprecipe.com). 
#           To overcome this challenge, I developed a custom script utilizing Elixir and leveraging the capabilities of Floki, an HTML parsing library.           
#
#           Additionally, I used [Explorer](https://github.com/elixir-nx/explorer) based on Polars, which is the equivalent of Pandas but written in Rust.
#           During the development process, I utilized [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/), a tool similar to Jupyter,
#           to explore and analyze the data in an interactive environment.
#           The app is being built with SwiftUI and utilizes Core Data for seamless data management.
